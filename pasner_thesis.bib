journal="The European Physical Journal C",
year="2015",
month="May",
day="09",
volume="75",
number="5",
pages="204",
abstract="We present LO, NLO and NNLO sets of parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton determined from global analyses of the available hard scattering data. These MMHT2014 PDFs supersede the `MSTW2008' parton sets, but they are obtained within the same basic framework. We include a variety of new data sets, from the LHC, updated Tevatron data and the HERA combined H1 and ZEUS data on the total and charm structure functions. We also improve the theoretical framework of the previous analysis. These new PDFs are compared to the `MSTW2008' parton sets. In most cases the PDFs, and the predictions, are within one standard deviation of those of MSTW2008. The major changes are the {\$}{\$}u-d{\$}{\$}u-dvalence quark difference at small {\$}{\$}x{\$}{\$}xdue to an improved parameterisation and, to a lesser extent, the strange quark PDF due to the effect of certain LHC data and a better treatment of the {\$}{\$}D {\backslash}rightarrow {\backslash}mu {\$}{\$}D{\textrightarrow}$\mu$branching ratio. We compare our MMHT PDF sets with those of other collaborations; in particular with the NNPDF3.0 sets, which are contemporary with the present analysis.",

pages="140",
abstract="We include finite top- and bottom-mass effects in the next-to-next-to-leading order parton shower (NNLOPS) event generator for inclusive Higgs boson production in gluon fusion based upon the POWHEG+MiNLO approach. Since fixed-order results for quark-mass effects only reach NLO accuracy, we add them to the NNLOPS generator at that accuracy. We explore uncertainties related to the unknown all-order logarithmic structure of bottom-mass effects by comparing the assumption of full exponentiation to no exponentiation at all. Phenomenological results showing the effects of finite quark-masses in the NNLOPS simulation are presented. These suggest that the aforementioned uncertainty is well contained within the envelope of plain renormalization and factorization scale uncertainties.",

For this implementation we have used a new interface of the POWHEG BOX with MadGraph4, that generates the codes for generic Born and real processes automatically. The virtual corrections have been taken from the MCFM code. We carry out a simple phenomenological study of our generators, comparing them among each other and with fixed next-to-leading order results.",
