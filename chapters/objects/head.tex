\chapter{Physics Object Definitions} \label{chap:objects}

In order to analyze the data one must first reconstruct the detector-level
output into representations of real physical particles (physics objects).  This
process begins once an event is accepted by the ATLAS trigger system and
recorded to disk, as discussed in \Cref{sec:atlas:trigger}.  This raw detector
output, such as energy deposits in the calorimeters or hits in the inner
detector, is then fed into a system of algorithms which build objects of
interest such as jets and muons.  These complex objects can then be used as
representations of the true SM particles in the analysis.  Since these
representations are only as good as the measurement and reconstruction
algorithms, they are then calibrated and given an uncertainty as discussed in
\Cref{chap:systematics}. This chapter gives an overview of the methodology used
to reconstruct the objects required for the boosted $H \rightarrow b\bar{b}$
analysis.
