\chapter{Physics Object Definitions} \label{chap:objects}

In order to analyze our data we must first give definitions for how we
reconstruct the detector level output into representations of real physical
particles (physics objects).  This process begins once an event is accepted by
the ATLAS trigger system, discussed in \Cref{sec:atlas:trigger}, to be recorded
to disk.  This low-level detector output, such as energy deposits in the
calorimeters or hits in the inner detector, is then fed into a system of
algorithms which build objects of interest such as jets and muons.  These
complex objects can then be used as representations of the true SM particles as
part of our analysis.  Since these representations are only as good as our
measurment and reconstruction algorithms, they are then calibrated and given an
uncertainty as discussed in \Cref{chap:systematics}. This chapter gives an
overview of the methodology used to reconstruct the objects required for the
Boosted $H \rightarrow b\bar{b}$ analysis.
