\chapter{Physics Object Selection} \label{chap:objects}

After the ATHENA Digitization step both data and monte carlo have the same
format, representing the three dimentional energy deposits.  In order to analyze
these deposits they are cleaned, clustered and checked for overlap resulting in
physics objects useful for our specific analysis.
