\section{Flavor Tagged Jets} \label{sec:objects:flavor_tagging}

In general our reconstruction algorithms for jets are agnostic to the "flavor"
label - light ($l$), charm ($c$) or bottom ($b$) - of the hadrons inside of
the shower.  However, flavor tagging \cite{Aad:2015ydr} is a powerful tool for
discriminating the $b\bar{b}$ decay products of the Higgs from the large,
predominantly light-flavor, QCD background.  These $b$-quark initiated jets are
identified using multivariate tools that take as inputs the kinematics of the
jet ($p_{T}$ and $|\eta|$), as well as the outputs of three tracking algorithms
to look for signatures consistent with $b$-hadron decays.  As we shall see
tracking information is crucial to flavor tagging and thus can only be applied
within the traacking volume ($|\eta| < 2.5$).
