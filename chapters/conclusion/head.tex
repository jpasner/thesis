A search for Boosted $H \rightarrow b\bar{b}$ was performed using an integrated
luminosity of $80.5 \text{fb}^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data recorded at
the ATLAS experiment with a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13~\TeV$. The
analysis of this data measured a signal strength for the SM Higgs Boson's decay
to $b\bar{b}$ of $\mu_{H} = 5.8 \pm 3.1~\mathrm{(stat.)} \pm
1.9~\mathrm{(syst.)} \pm 1.7~\mathrm{(th.)}$, which is consistent with the
background only hypothesis at 1.6 standard deviations given an expected
sensitivity of $0.28\sigma$.  The CMS collaboration performed a similar
analysis in 2017 with an integrated luminosity of $39.5~\ifb$ and found a
signal strength for Boosted $H \rightarrow b\bar{b}$ of $\mu_{H} = 2.3 \pm
1.5~\text{(stat.)}_{-0.4}^{+1.0}~\text{(syst.)}$ which is consistent with this
analysis' measurement within 2 standard deviations \cite{Sirunyan:2017dgc}.

This is the first time this analysis has been performed in ATLAS and thus
represents important advancements in the use of boosted jet techniques and the
implementation of new techniques such as the variable radius jet.  Future work
in this novel channel will be necessary to optimize these new techniques and to
reduce the major systematics presented in \Cref{chap:systematics}.  The ATLAS
calorimeter design gives an excellent energy resolution over mass resolution,
making software improvements to jet technologies an important avenue of
research for future versions of this analysis. Within ATLAS there is active
work to include a technology known as particle flow into the large-$R$ jet
reconstruction. This algorithm combines calorimeter measurements of
neutral-particle energies with information from charged hadron tracks in the ID
to give better jet resolution.  Furthermore, studies of new substructure based
triggers offer future improvements to the signal event selection.

In conclusion, this dissertation serves as a validation of the predictions of
the Standard Model, presents new techniques for the analysis of Boosted
signatures in the ATLAS collaboration, and provides a measurement in the
Higgs sector representing a new contribution to the field.
