\chapter{Data and Monte Carlo Simulation} \label{chap:data}

This analysis focuses on the data collected by the ATLAS detector from \pp
collisions produced by the LHC at the center-of-mass energy of $13~\TeV$.  In
particular the analysis uses datasets collected in 2015, 2016, and 2017 which
correspond to an integrated luminosity of $80.5~\ifb$ after beam, detector and
data-quality requirements are taken into account. 

In order to compare our findings with theory, the predictions of the SM are used
to produce Monte Carlo (MC) simulated events to model the signal and background
processes.  These MC samples go through a full simulation of the ATLAS detector
and are reconstructed using the same algorithms as used on data, so the MC and
data have the same format at analysis level. This allows us to analyze the MC
and data using the same framework and make direct comparisons between theory
and measurement as our final product.

The following sections describe the systems for selecting the data used in the
analysis and the software packages, developed in collaboration with theorists,
used to simulate the signal and background processes relevant to the analysis.
