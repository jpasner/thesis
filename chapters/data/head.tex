\chapter{Data and Monte-Carlo Simulation} \label{chap:data}

This analysis focuses on the data collected by the ATLAS detector from \pp
collisions produced by the LHC at the center-of-mass-energy of 13 TeV.  In
particular the analysis shown uses datasets collected in 2015, 2016, and 2017
and ammounts to an integrated luminosity of $80.5 \text{ fb}^{-1}$ after beam,
detector and data-quality requirements are taken into account. 

In order to compare our findings with theory, we use the predictions of the SM
to produce Monte-Carlo (MC) simulated events to model the signal and background
processes.  These MC samples go through a full simulation of the ATLAS detector
and are reconstructed using the same algorithms as used on data such that the
MC and Data have the same format at analysis level. This allows us to analyze
the MC and Data using the same framework such that we can make direct
comparisons between theory and reality as our final product.

The following sections discuss the systems for selecting the data used in the
analysis as well as the software packages, developed in collaboration with
theorists, used to simulate the signal and background processes of the
analysis.
