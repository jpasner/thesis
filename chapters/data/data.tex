\section{Data Used} \label{sec:data:data}

As mentioned before the data used is checked to make sure it is of high
quality, meaning that the beam, detector and data collection systems were all
fully opperational during the event in question. These data quality
requirements are enfored by choosing only events from each respective years
Good Runs List (GRL), an XML file produced by the ATLAS data quality
monitoring team that lists all events that have met the data quality critera.
This analysis uses three such GRLs - one for each year of data taking
(2015,2016,2017) - corresponding to annual integrated luminosities of $3.2
\text{ fb}^{-1}$, $33 \text{ fb}^{-1}$, and $44.3 \text{ fb}^{-1}$.
