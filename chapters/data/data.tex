\section{Data Used} \label{sec:data:data}

As mentioned earlier, the data are checked to make sure they are of high
quality, meaning that the beam, detector and data collection systems were all
fully operational during the event in question. These data quality requirements
are encored by choosing only events from each respective year's Good Runs List
(GRL), an XML file produced by the ATLAS data quality monitoring team that
lists all luminosity blocks that have met the data quality criteria.  This
analysis uses three such GRLs - one for each year of data taking
(2015, 2016, 2017) - corresponding to annual integrated luminosities of
$3.2~\ifb$, $33~\ifb$, and $44.3~\ifb$.
