\section{ATLAS Data Analyzed} \label{sec:data:data}

As mentioned earlier, the data are checked to make sure they are of high
quality, meaning that the beam, detector and data collection systems were all
fully operational for the given bunch crossing event. These data quality
requirements are enforced by choosing only events from each respective year's
Good Runs List (GRL), an XML file produced by the ATLAS data quality monitoring
team that lists all luminosity blocks that have met the data quality criteria.
This analysis uses three such GRLs - one for each year of data taking (2015,
2016, 2017) - corresponding to annual integrated luminosities of $3.2~\ifb$,
$33~\ifb$, and $44.3~\ifb$.
