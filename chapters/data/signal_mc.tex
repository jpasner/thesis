\section{Signal Monte Carlo} \label{sec:data:signal_mc}

In order to simulate Boosted Higgs events the three leading production mechanisms at
the LHC were considered, shown in \Cref{fig:higgs_production}: gluon-gluon
fusion, vector boson fusion and Higgstralungh.  These three production modes
correspondingly represent 50\%, 30\% and 20\% of the total Higgs signal before
analysis cuts are applied. 

The ggF plus an associated jet events were generated using the
\textsc{HJ+MiNLO} prescription~\cite{Hamilton2015} with the finite top mass
assumption with the \textsc{Powheg-Box} 2 generator~\cite{Campbell:2012} and
the NNPDF30 NNLO parton distribution function~\cite{Hamilton:2012rf}.  After the events 
are generated the
