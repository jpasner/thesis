\section{Hadronic Vector Boson Background} \label{sec:background:vqq}

The $V+\text{jets}$ template is constructed by fitting the generated MC
histogram with the sum of three Gaussians plus a constant term.  The systematic
variations, discussed in \Cref{chap:systematics}, of this template are re-fit
using the same functional choices.  This results in smooth histograms to be
used as input to the fit discussed in \Cref{chap:fit}.
