\section{Accelerator complex layout and design} \label{sec:lhc:layout}

We begin with the most common element in the Universe, hydrogen, as our source
of protons.  A bottle of hydrogen gas provides raw $H_{2}$ which is then
injected into a Duoplasmatron which uses a strong electric field to break the
molecule into bare $H^{+}$ aka a proton!  The proton is then accelerated by a 90
kV supply and leaves the Duoplasmatron with 1.4\% speed of light (~4000
km/s).
