We begin with the most common element in the Universe, hydrogen, as our source
of protons.  A bottle of hydrogen gas provides 100 microsecond pulses of raw
$H_{2}$ which is then injected into a Duoplasmatron. There,  a strong electric
field and free elctrons from a cathode ionize the molecule into bare $H^{+}$
aka a proton!  These protons are then accelerated by a 90kV electric field,
leaving the Duoplasmatron at 1.4\% the speed of light ($\sim$4000km/s) or, in
Particle Physics units, about 83KeV. The bare protons are then fed into the
accelerating Radio Frequency (RF) cavities of Linear Accelerator 2 (LINAC2).
Inside, conductors charged by a powerful oscillating electromagnetic field
accelerate the protons to an energy of 50MeV. Along the way, small
quadrupole magnets shape the proton bunch ensuring they remain in a tight
beam.  This pattern of acceleration with RF cavities and shaping/tuning with
magnets is then repeated with CERN's first synchrotron, the Proton Synchrotron
(PS) rendering a 1.4 GeV proton beam.  The final step before the LHC comes with the
Super Proton Synchrotron where the same technologies are implemented to produce
450 GeV protons, ready for injection into the LHC. A diagrammatic representation
of this chain can be seen in \Cref{fig:injection_chain}. 

In order to produce proton-proton collisions, the LHC uses two beams
circulating in opposite directions.  The beams are not continuous, but instead
consist of bunches of $\mathcal{O}(10^{11})$ protons with a spacing of 25ns.
Given the LHC circumference this allows for 3564 bunches, however only 2808 are
filled per beam due to safety requirements and injection limitations.  Each
beam takes 4 minutes and 20 seconds to fill and then an additional 20 minutes
to for the protons to reach their maximum energy of 7 TeV, or 99.99999991\%
the speed of light! Under normal operating conditions these beams can be used
for many hours.
