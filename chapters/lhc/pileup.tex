\section{Pile-up at the LHC} \label{sec:lhc:pileup}

Given the large number of protons per bunch and the cross-section of a
proton-proton interaction, the probability to observe multiple interactions per
bunch crossing is quite high.  These multiple-interaction are known as pile-up,
$\mu$ or the time-averaged representation $\langle \mu \rangle$, and comes in two
different forms: 

\begin{enumerate} \item \textbf{In-time pile-up:} These are the other
proton-proton collisions that occur during the same bunch crossing as the
primary interaction that cauesd the Data Aquisition (DAQ) system to trigger.
These are the standard extra interactions we expect to observe as stated above.
\item \textbf{Out-of-time pile-up:} These are interactions that occur either
before or after a bunch crossing that causes the DAQ to trigger.  This effect is
generally due to the long integration times of some detector electronics.
\end{enumerate}

The pile-up profile for past years can be seen in \cref{fig:pileup}.  The width
of this distributino is due a combination of Poisonian statistics, the decrease
in number of protons per bunch over the lifetime of a single run, and
optimization tweaks to the beam's profile during the LHC's operation.
Understanding and eliminating the noise from these pile-up events is crucial to
reconstructing physics variables that describe the primary interaction we aim
to observe.
