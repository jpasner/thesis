\chapter{The Standard Model and Beyond} \label{chap:standard_model}

The Standard Model (SM) of Particle Physics is humanities best "guess" at the
force laws that describe the observed behavior of all particles in our
universe. Its formulation is a collection of Quantum Field Theories (QFT) that
describe the following interactions of elementary matter in Nature: the
electromagnetic force, the weak nuclear force and the strong nuclear force.
Gravity is noticeably absent as currently there is no viable quantum theory for
observed gravitational effects.  The Glashow-Weinberg-Salam theory of Quantum
Electrodynamics (QED) describes the electromagnetic and weak forces, while
Quantum Chromodyanmics (QCD) describes the strong force.  These theories form
the following symmetry group of the Standard Model.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:standardmodel:symmetry_group}
  \underbrace{\text{SU}_\text{C}(3)}_\text{QCD} \otimes \underbrace{\text{SU}_\text{L}(2) \otimes \text{U}_\text{Y}(1)}_\text{QED}.
\end{equation}

The gauge principle states that the SM Lagrangian and its predictions must be
invariant under local transformations using an operator from any of these
constituent groups.  Thus, any theory must only include transformations and
terms that maintain the local invariance of the complete Lagrangian.  In
particular, this requirement was violated by any attempt to include an explicit
mass term for the Gauge Bososns of QED and for all fermions.  Around 1960 a
possible solution to this lack of mass was proposed in the form of the
spontaneous breaking of the ElectroWeak symmetry, now known as the Higgs
mechanism.  In the following sections I will go into more detail about the
Lagrangian formalism of the Standard Model, QCD, QED and this recently verified
Higgs Mechanism.
