\section{Parton Distribution Function} \label{sec:theory:pdf}

Before QFT the proton was thought to be a hard ball containing no smaller
constituents.  However, we know now that that the strong field inside the proton
allows for any strong object to exist with some probability which changes based
off of the total energy of the proton.  This behavior is represented then by a
Probability Distribution Function.
