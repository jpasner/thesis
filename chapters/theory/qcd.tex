\section{Quantum Chromodynamics} \label{sec:theory:qcd}

Quantum Chromodynamics is the continuation of the mathematical framework
established by the electroweak formalism in \Cref{sec:theory:gsw}, this time
for the strong force described by the $SU(3)_C$ gauge group, where $C$
represents the ``color" charge of QCD \cite{Campbell:2017hsr}.  This
color charge doesn't imply actual visible color, but is useful as an analogy to
the visible spectrum where a combination of red, green, and blue generates
white.  For QCD the combination of red, green, and blue color charges can
result in a colorless object.  As mentioned in \Cref{sec:theory:fermions}, the
quarks have a color (anti-color) charge defining color triplet field which
transforms under the general $SU(3)$ transformation as

\begin{equation}
q = \left( \begin{matrix} q_{r} \\ q_{g} \\ q_{b} \end{matrix} \right)
\rightarrow q^{'} = exp \left( ig_{s} \sum_{k=1}^{8} \eta_{k}(x)
\frac{\lambda_k}{2} \right) q
\end{equation}

Here the $\lambda_{k}$ are the Gell-Mann generators for $SU(3)$, $\eta(x)_{k}$ is the
space-time dependency for each generator, and  $g_s$ is the strong coupling constant.
As with the electroweak Lagrangian, the introduction of these space-time dependent terms adds new
terms into the kinematic portion of the Lagrangian and spoils the gauge 
invariance.  Again, a covariant derivative is introduced 

\begin{equation}
D_{\mu} = \partial_{\mu} - ig_{s}G_{\mu}^{k}\frac{\lambda_{k}}{2}
\end{equation}

to restore gauge invariance. The $G_{\mu}^{k}$ are the new fields introduced
for the 8 gluons.  These new fields transform under $SU(3)$ as

\begin{equation} \label{eq:qcd:gluon_field}
G_{\mu}^{k} \rightarrow G_{\mu}^{'k} = G_{\mu}^{k} + \partial_{\mu}\eta_{k}(x) +
g_{s}f_{klm}\eta_{l}(x)G_{\mu}^{m}
\end{equation}

Given these definitions the QCD Lagrangian ($\mathcal{L}_{QCD}$) can be
constructed as 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:qcd:qcd_lagrangian}
\mathcal{L}_{QCD} = \bar{q}(i\gamma_{\mu}D^{\mu} - m_{q})q -
\frac{1}{4}G_{k}^{\mu\nu}G_{k\mu\nu}
\end{equation}

where the gluon field tensor $G_{k}^{\mu\nu}$ is defined as

\begin{equation} \label{eq:qcd:gluon_tensor}
G_{k}^{\mu\nu} = \partial^{\mu}G_{k}^{\nu} - \partial^{\nu}G_{k}^{\mu} +
g_{s}f_{klm}G_{\l}^{\mu}G_{m}^{\nu}.
\end{equation}

The strong force is peculiar in that experiments observe only colorless objects
in the form of bound states of quarks known as hadrons.  Qualitatively, the
potential between quarks in a bound state (meson or baryon) gets stronger with
separation, unlike the other forces.  At the point where the system would
separate into color-charged objects, it becomes energetically favorable to
produce a quark/anti-quark pair in a process known as hadronization.  In other
words, attempting to separate a bound quark state into its colored constituents
simply results in new colorless bound states.  This requirement of colorless
objects by the strong force is known as color confinement. For highly energetic
strong interactions at hadron colliders the result is an expanding chain of
hadronizing quarks and gluons and their decay products known as a jet.
