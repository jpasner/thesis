\chapter{Results} \label{chap:results}

This chapter summarizes the results and interpretation of the Boosted $H
\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ search described in this thesis and published in
Reference \cite{ATLAS-CONF-2018-052}.  To arrive at this point; the theory was
presented (\Cref{chap:standard_model,chap:higgs}), the data was collected
(\Cref{chap:atlas,chap:lhc}), a simulation of the data from theory was
constructed (\Cref{chap:data}), physics objects were built in data and MC
(\Cref{chap:objects}), events were then selected for analysis
(\Cref{chap:selection}), the backgrounds were modelled
(\Cref{chap:background}), sources of error were discussed
(\Cref{chap:systematics}), and finally all of these considerations were
combined in statistical fit (\Cref{chap:fit}). This procedure gives an estimate
of the observed signal significance and signal strength ($\mu_{s}$) for the
Boosted $V \rightarrow b\bar{b}$ which is used as a standard candle to validate
the analysis, and the Boosted $H \rightarrow b\bar{b}$ which is the parameter
of interest. This final result serves as a validation of the predictions of the
Standard Model, presents new techniques for the analysis of Boosted signatures,
and provides a measurement of the Higgs sector representing a new contribution
to the field. The following sections briefly outline the extraction of the
results and presents the measured quantities.
