\chapter{Statistical Fit} \label{chap:fit}

The final significance of $V$ + jets and Higgs + jets production are quantified
through a Bayesian implementation of a likelihood function.  This procedure
uses the information known about the systematic uncertanties and normalization
of the signal before the fit, called priors, along with the template histograms
representing the impact of each prior on the distribution of interest $m_{J}$.
These priors are then iteratively updated by the data, contained in a
likelihood function, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedure.  This results
in a marginalized probability density function (p.d.f) which represents the
probability of there being a number of signal events present in the data.  This
p.d.f is then used to determine the signal strength $\mu_{s}$ and its
uncertainty as well as a 95\% credibility level (CL).  The following chapter
will discuss the theory and implementation of these ideas in the context of the
systematics presented in \Cref{chap:systematics} using the Bayesian Analysis
Toolkit (BAT) \cite{Beaujean:2011zz}.
