\chapter{The ATLAS Detector} \label{chap:atlas}

Given the immense energies available at the LHC, and the veritable zoo of
paricles we are trying to detect, we require a general-purpose experiment in
order to fully exploit the full range of physics opportunities provided.  Two
international collaborations rose to this challenge, the CMS (Compact Muon
Solenoid) and ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) experiments.  While both have
similar physics goals and each of them strengths and weaknesses, this
dissertation will focus on the ATLAS experiment and the intricacies of its three
sub-detectors and two massive magnet systems depicted in
\cref{fig:atlas_cutaway}.

Originally proposed in 1994, the ATLAS detector was completed in 2008. On
July 4th, 2012 in a joint announcement the ATLAS and CMS experiments presented
the discovery of the long predicted Higgs Boson.  The ATLAS collaboration now boasts
over 3000 physicists from 175 institutions spread across 38 countries and
continues to probe the limits of the Standard Model in pursuit of answers to
some of humanity's deepest questions.

Located approximately 100 meters underground in a vast excavated chamber, the
ATLAS detector rests its 7000 metric tons on a bed of concrete-reinforced
steel.  Out of it flows the signals from 100 million electronic channels
through a zip-tied mass of 3000+ kilometers of cabling.  At its very center is
one of the four interaction points of the LHC, specifically Point 1, where the
two counter circulating proton beams are shaped and then brought together by a
series of magnets.  The energetic particles resulting from this collision then
fly out in all directions into the bulk of the ATLAS detector.

The first sub-system they meet is the Inner Detector (ID) and its many layers of
strip and pixel silcon detectors along with a transition radiation gaseous wire
detector, all bathed in the 2T mangnetic field from the surrounding superconducting
solenoidal magnet.  This system exploits the ionization of charged particles to
track their curved trajectory through the magnetic field.  This curvature gives
us charge information, a momentum measurement, and precisely-located 3D vertices
crucial to the identification of the secondary vertices of a B-hadron decay. 

Outside of the solenoid the particles encounter the Electromagnetic and then
the Hadronic sampling calorimeters. Here, layers of scintillator and high
radiation length materials are implemented to measure the energy of electrons,
photons, and hadrons. As the goal is to completely absorb the energy of all
outgoing particles the calorimeter has a nearly $4\pi$ solid angle coverage.

Finally we have the muon system surrounding the calorimeter and equipped with
its own toroidal magnet system.  Here the charged muon bends in the magnetic
field while leaving a trail of ionization in the Muon Spectrometer before
exiting the detector completely.  Neutrinos are the only other Standard Model
particle that leave the detector, however they do so without detection.  A
depiction of the various particle interactions with the different detector
sub-systems can be seen in \cref{fig:detector_interactions}

In the following sections I will explain our chosen coordinate system and give 
a more detailed review of these three detector sub-systems.

interact with each component of the detector it crosses.  A dashed line
indicates no interaction while a solid line indicates interaction. Electrons
(yellow/green) and charged hadrons (red) interact with the tracker and curve in
the solenoid's magnetic field.  Electrons and photons (yellow/green) are
absorbed by the Electromagnetic calorimeter.  All hadrons (red/yellow) are
absorbed by the Hadronic calorimeter. The muons (orange) curve in both the
solenoid and toroid magnetic fields before exiting the detector. Finally, the
neutrinos (white) pass through the entire detector without interacting.  }
