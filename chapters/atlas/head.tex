\chapter{The ATLAS Detector} \label{chap:atlas}

The immense energies available at the LHC and the veritable zoo of particles
require a general-purpose experiment in order to fully exploit the full range
of physics opportunities.  Two international collaborations rose to this
challenge, the CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) and ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS)
experiments.  While both have similar physics goals and each of them strengths
and weaknesses, this dissertation will focus on the ATLAS experiment and the
intricacies of its three sub-detectors and two massive magnet systems depicted
in \Cref{fig:atlas_cutaway}.

Originally proposed in 1994, the ATLAS detector saw its first events in  2008
\cite{ATLAS_TDR, ATLAS_first_beam}. On July 4th, 2012 in a joint announcement
the ATLAS and CMS experiments presented the discovery of the long predicted
Higgs Boson \cite{Aad:2012tfa, Chatrchyan:2012xdj, higgs_announcement}.  The
ATLAS collaboration now boasts over 3000 physicists from 175 institutions
spread across 38 countries and continues to probe the limits of the Standard
Model in pursuit of answers to some of humanity's deepest questions.

Located approximately 100 meters underground in a vast excavated chamber, the
ATLAS detector rests its 7000 metric tons on a bed of steel-reinforced
concrete.  Out of it flow the signals from 100 million electronic channels
through a zip-tied mass of 3000+ kilometers of cabling.  At its very center is
one of the four interaction points of the LHC, Point 1, where the
two counter-circulating proton beams are shaped by a
series of magnets.  The energetic particles resulting from this collision then
fly out in all directions into the bulk of the ATLAS detector.

The first sub-system they meet is the Inner Detector (ID) and its many layers
of strip and pixel silicon detectors, along with a transition radiation gaseous
wire detector, all bathed in the 2T magnetic field from the surrounding
superconducting solenoidal magnet.  This system exploits the ionization signal
of charged particles to track their curved trajectory through the magnetic
field.  This curvature gives us charge information, a momentum measurement, and
precisely-located 3D vertices crucial to the identification of the secondary
vertices of a $b$-hadron decay. 

Outside of the solenoid the particles encounter the electromagnetic and then
the hadronic sampling calorimeters. Here, layers of scintillator and
high-radiation-length materials are interleaved to measure the energy of
electrons, photons, and hadrons. As the goal is to completely absorb the energy
of all outgoing particles, the calorimeter has a nearly $4\pi$ solid angle
coverage.

The outermost subsystem, the muon spectrometer, surrounds the calorimeter and
is equipped with its own toroidal magnet system.  Here the charged muons bend
in the magnetic field while leaving a trail of ionization in the Muon
Spectrometer (MS) before exiting the detector completely.  Neutrinos are the
only other Standard Model particle that leave the detector; however they, do so
without detection.  A depiction of the various particle interactions with the
different detector sub-systems can be seen in \Cref{fig:detector_interactions}.

\caption{This slice of the ATLAS detector depicts how different particles
interact with each component of the detector they cross.  A dashed line
indicates no interaction while a solid line indicates interaction. Electrons
(yellow/green) and charged hadrons (red) interact with the tracker and curve in
the solenoid's magnetic field.  Electrons and photons (yellow/green) are
absorbed by the electromagnetic calorimeter.  All hadrons (red/yellow) are
absorbed by the hadronic calorimeter. The muons (orange) curve in both the
solenoid and toroid magnetic fields before exiting the detector. Finally, the
neutrinos (white) pass through the entire detector without interacting
