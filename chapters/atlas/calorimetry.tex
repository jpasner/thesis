Once the proton collision remnants have passed through the ID and it's
surrounding solenoid they enter into the ATLAS calorimeters depicted in figure
\ref{fig:calorimeter_cutaway}.  Sampling calorimeter technologies were choosen
for their compact geometry and lower cost point.  These are constructed by
alternating layers of absorber, a dense material which reduces the incedent
particles energy, and active material which produces a detectible signal when a
partilce passes through.  This means that the detected signal is only a fraction
of the total energy of the particle and thus requires a study of the calorimeter
response for calibration purposes \cite{Fabjan:692252}. The first system, the
Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMC), is designed to measure the energy of
electrons and photons which primarily lose their energy via bremstralung and
pair production electromagnetic interactions.  Outside of the EMC is the
Hadronic Calorimeter (HC) which is designed to measure the energy of jets of
hadrons through their electromagnetic and strong interactions. These detectors
cover the entire $|\eta| < 4.9$ range and provide complete containment of both
Electromagnetic and Hadronic showers with higher granularityi in the EMC for
$|\eta| < 2.5$, the region matched to the ID, for precision measruements of
electrons and photos.  By instrumenting this huge space in $|\eta|$ we can
search for events with asymetric energy deposits which imply the existence of a
particle we didn't detect represented by missing transverse energy $\MET$.

\subsection{Electromagnetic Calorimeter}

The innermost calorimeter, the Liquid Argon (LAr) Electromagnetic Calorimeter
(EMC) \cite{PERF-2007-01}, uses lead as the absorber and liquid argon as
the active material in an "accordion geometry" as seen in figure
\ref{fig:accordion}. This geometry was choosen for uniform coverage in
$\hat{\phi}$ due to its lack of un-instrumented cracks in the radial direction.
The barrel region covers $|\eta| < 1.475$ and an end cap on each side covers
$1.375 < |\eta| < 3.2$ each housed in their own cryostat.  The barrel is
composed of two half barrels with a 4mm gap at $z = 0$ and both end caps are
divided into an intter wheel covering $2.5 < |\eta| < 3.2$ and an outer wheel
covering $1.375 < |\eta| < 2.5$.

and liquid argon layers are visible in an accordion like geometry. Looking from
the foreground to the back there are 3 different types of cells visible.}

In the $|\eta| < 2.5$ region the EMC has 3 radial layers for precision physics
measurements.  Layer 1 consists of strip cells which are finely segmented with
$\Delta\eta = 0.0031$ and $\Delta\phi = 0.0245$ allowing for precision position
resolution which gives discrimination power between a single $\gamma$ deposit
and the $\pi^0$ characteristic $\gamma\gamma$ deposit. Layer 2 , which collects
the largest fraction of energy from electromagnetic shower, is segmented with
$\Delta\eta = .025$ and $\Delta\phi = 0.0245$. Layer 3 collects the tail of the
electromagnetic shower using a coarser segmentation of $\Delta\eta = .05$ and
$\Delta\phi = 0.0245$.  Additionally, in the region $|\eta| < 1.8$ a thin
pre-sampler , which contains no lead absorber, was placed in front of Layer 1 to
allow for energy corrections due to losses upstream of the EMC.  Combined the
EMC is $>$ 22 radiation lengths ($X_0$) in the barrel and $>$ 24 $X_0$ in the
end-caps, where a radiation length is the average distance an electron travels
in a given material before losing $1/e$ of its original energy $E_0$ via
bremsstrahlung radiation.

\subsection{Hadronic Calorimeter}

Directly outside the EMC envelope is the Hadronic Calorimeter (HC) system
\cite{PERF-2007-01} which consists of three sampling calorimeter technologies:
the Tile calorimeter, the LAr hadronic end-cap calorimeter (HEC) and the LAr
forward calorimeter (FCal).  Combined, these three subsystems give measurements
of hadronic jet energies in the $0 <|\eta| < 4.9$ range. The tile calorimeter
uses steel as the absorber layer and scintillating tiles as the active material
and covers the region $|\eta| < 1.7$ with a barrel section flanked by two barrel
extensions each divided azimuthally into 64 modules.  These scintillator tiles
are read out on two sides by wave-length shifting fibers connected to
photomultiplier tubes as seen in figure \ref{fig:tile_calorimeter}. At $\eta =
0$ the total tile calorimeter thickness is 9.7 nuclear interaction lengths
($\lambda$), where $\lambda$ is the average distance a hadron travels before
interacting inellastically with a nucleus.

The HEC is composed of two independent wheels per end-cap located just past the
EMC end-cap but sharing the same cryostat. This system  uses copper as an
absorber and liquid argon for the active material and covers the $1.5 < |\eta| <
3.2$ range using 32 wdge-shaped modules per wheel. Finally, the FCal shares the
same cryostat as the EMC and HEC end-caps and acts to extend the coverage of the
combined calorimeter system to include the $3.1 < |\eta| < 4.9$ range.  Each
endcap contains 3 modules, the first an electromagnetic module
(Copper/Liquid-Argon) which is followed by two hadronic modules which use
(Tungsten/Liquid-Argon.
