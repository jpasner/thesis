\chapter{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
As children we are fascinated with the natural world that surrounds us.  How
was it made? What is it made of?  Why is it made of that? Where did it come
from?  When was it made? These questions follow some of us into adulthood and
lead to the study of the fundamental interactions of the Universe, the pursuit
of the building blocks of reality.  For the past century, experiments of
increasing size and complexity have probed higher energies and smaller
distances to answer these questions out of the pure desire to know the unknown.
The results of these experiments have been interpreted and used to build the
most predictive and successful theory across all of science - the Standard
Model (SM) of particle physics. At the current state-of-the-art facility, the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC), an international team of scientists and engineers
continue this legacy of discovery.  There, protons are smashed together at
energies not seen since the birth of the Universe some 13.8 billion years ago
and the results are analyzed to answer the outstanding questions of our time.

In 2012 the discovery of a Higgs-like boson at CERN by the ATLAS and CMS
collaborations answered one of these outstanding questions, namely: What is the
origin of mass for particles in the SM \cite{Aad:2012tfa,Chatrchyan:2012xdj}?
This was a major triumph for both the theoretical and experimental particle
physics communities and resulted in the Nobel Prize in Physics being awarded to
Francois Englert and Peter W. Higgs for their contributions to the Higgs Boson
theory. However, the properties of this new particle are still under
verification and new physics could be lurking in the large uncertainties of
current observations of the SM Higgs boson.  In particular, the coupling
strength of the Higgs boson to bottom quarks ($H \rightarrow b\bar{b}$) was
only observed in 2018 and still contains a large uncertainty on the
measurement. Furthermore, the $H \rightarrow b\bar{b}$ decay mode has yet to be
observed for the vector boson fusion and gluon-gluon fusion production
mechanisms.  Finally, there is evidence that new physics could be accessible in
analysis observing highly boosted Higgs bosons produced via gluon-gluon fusion.
Thus, the goal of this analysis is to make a direct measurement of the coupling
of the Higgs to bottom quarks, with particular focus on the observation in the
gluon-gluon fusion and vector boson fusion production modes. 

\Cref{part:theory} of this dissertation describes the Standard Model of
particle physics including the Higgs mechanism and motivates the search for a
highly boosted $H \rightarrow b\bar{b}$. \Cref{part:experiment} describes both
the LHC and the ATLAS detector located at CERN. Lastly, \Cref{part:HbbISR}
presents the data analysis and the Boosted Higgs boson measurement results.
