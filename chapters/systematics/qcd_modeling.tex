\section{Uncertainties on Data-Driven QCD Modeling} \label{sec:systematics:qcd_modeling}

The QCD background estimate discussed in \Cref{sec:background:qcd} is based on
a direct fit to data. The choice of function used to fit the QCD background is
empirically based so it is important to consider the uncertainty introduced by
this choice.  The uncertainty is modeled by considering the differences between
the nominal polynomial exponential function in \Cref{sec:background:polynomial}
and the alternate formal Laurent series \Cref{sec:background:laurent} in a
series of pseudoexperiments. Samples are produced via Poisson sampling of the
QCD component of the fit to the SR which contains all components of the full
model (QCD, $Z$ + jets, $W$ + jets, $t\bar{t}$, and the Higgs boson signal) but
no nuisance parameters. These samples are then fit with the nominal and
alternative function choices.  The uncertainty bands from these two sets of
fits provide a measure of the statistical uncertainty on the multijet
parameterization derived from the spread of fit parameters, and a systematic
uncertainty on the choice of fitting function derived from the difference
between the two fitted shapes.
