\chapter{Systematic Uncertainties} \label{chap:systematics}

This chapter presents the sources of systematic uncertainty in
the analysis that could result in biases to the final fit.  These sources of
uncertainty can come from experimental calibrations or procedures and from the
MC modeling of signal and background. They can contribute to uncertainties in
the overall yield (``normalization") and to the differential shape of the
signal candidate mass observable used in the statistical procedure for the
final fit.  The sources of uncertainty on the derivation of the QCD multijet
background are separated from the uncertainties on the resonant backgrounds as
the former is estimated using data while the later are estimated using MC
simulation.  Each of the relevant sources of uncertainty are briefly discussed
and a summary is presented.
