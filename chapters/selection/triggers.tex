\section{Selected Triggers} \label{sec:selection:triggers}

This analysis uses exclusively large-$R$ jet triggers in order to maximally
capture the boosted decay products of the Higgs.  However, looking at
\Cref{fig:pileup} we can see that the pile-up increased over the course of LHC
Run 2 thus requiring the High Level Trigger (HLT) $p_{T}$ requirement to
increase in order to maintain a low offline threshold for data recording.  This
results in a different triggering algortihm for the 2015, 2016, and 2017 data
taking years.  While all the triggers require a large-$R$ jet to be
reconstructed in the HLT, the 2015 and 2016 data taking years used an ungroomed
(a10) verion while in 2017 a trimmed (a10t) version was used.  In 2015 the
large-$R$ trigger looked for an ungroomed large-$R$ jet with $p_{T} > 360\GeV$.
In 2016 the $p_{T}$ threshold was raised to $420\GeV$.  In 2017 the requirement
changed to look for a trimmed large-$R$ jet with $p_{T} > 480\GeV$.  This
information is summarized in \Cref{table:triggers} which also details the integrated
luminosity for the trigger in question as well as the Offline $p_{T}$
Threshold.  Notice that the Offline Threshold differs from the HLT threshold.
This is due to the fact that the trigger must make a quick calculation of the
jet energy in order to keep data rates low, however this online calculation
sacrifices accuracy meaning that some jets that should have passed are instead
ignored.  This means that the $p_{T}$ distribution near the online threshold is
innacurate, resulting in a higher offline threshold where the trigger becomes
fully efficient.  All triggers used in this analysis are fully efficient for
an offline threshold of $p_{T} > 480\GeV$.  In order make sure all triggers are
fully effiecient, we require all events to contain a trimmed large-$R$ jet with
$p_{T} > 480\GeV$.
