\chapter{Boosted $H \rightarrow b\bar{b}$ Event Selection} \label{chap:selection}

Having discussed the methods used to reconstruct the physics objects needed to
accurately capture the boosted $H \rightarrow b\bar{b}$ final state, the next
consideration is the actual requirements made on these reconstructed objects.
These selections and quality criteria are applied to define the set of baseline
and candidate physics objects that will be used as part of the analysis.  This
includes the definition of multiple orthogonal control regions (CR) used during
the statistical fitting procedure for the characterization of backgrounds, as
well as the signal region (SR) where the actual Higgs search is realized.
