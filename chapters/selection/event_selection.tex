\section{Event Selection} \label{sec:selection:event_selection}

Starting from the events passing the large-$R$ jet trigger discussed in
\Cref{sec:selection:triggers}, further selections are made to maximize signal
sensitivity, reject background, and construct regions where the backgrounds
can be characterized.  

First, all events are preselected to make sure they contain at least two
large-$R$ jets with $\pT > 250~\GeV$~\footnote{The $250~\GeV$ cut off was the
lowest supported value by the JetEtMiss jet modeling group.} that fall entirely
within the ID instrumented region $|\eta| < 2.0$. This ensures that charged
tracks can be reconstructed for flavor tagging purposes.  Events are further
preselected by requiring the leading $\pT$ large-$R$ jet to have $\pT >
480~\GeV$ and the sub-leading $\pT$ large-R jet to have $\pT > 250~\GeV$. The
leading jet $\pT$ cut ensures that all events pass the offline $\pT$ threshold
for all three triggers.  The sub-leading jet $\pT$ cut is an explicit
requirement for the presence of the ISR jet. 

Next, the signal candidate large-$R$ jet, assumed to contain the decay products
of the Higgs, is selected from the list of large-$R$ jets passing the following
requirements.  The signal candidate must have $\pT > 480~\GeV$ and be
sufficiently boosted such that $p_{\text{T},J} > 2m_{J}$.  It must contain at
least 2 VR track-jets with $\pT > 10~\GeV$, as required for $b$-tagging.
Furthermore, the distance between the two leading VR track-jets ($\Delta
R_{VR}$) must be greater than the radius of the smaller of the two VR
track-jets (min$R_{VR}$).  This requirement helps avoid $b$-tagging anomalies
and prevent signal contamination from gluon splitting.  The highest-$\pT$ jet
that passes all of the above requirements is labeled the signal candidate, and
the next highest-$\pT$ large-$R$ jet in the list is taken to be the ISR jet.
Any events containing a muon with $\pT > 40~\GeV$ opposite the signal candidate
large-$R$ jet, $\Delta \phi > 2\pi/3$, are removed to ensure no overlap with
the $t\bar{t}$ control region ($\text{CR}_{t\bar{t}}$) discussed in
\Cref{sec:background:ttbar}.  The event selection process is illustrated in
\Cref{fig:event_selection}.

The signal candidate events are classified based on how
many of the two leading VR trackjets pass $b$-tagging criteria.  Two
$b$-tagging criteria were used: the ``loose" working point with 85\%
efficiency and the ``tight" working point with 77\%
efficiency~\footnote{These working points are determined by applying the
$b$-tagging algorithm to a Monte Carlo sample of $t\bar{t}$ events and then
checking the output against truth information to determine efficiencies.}.
Events with exactly 0 ``loose" $b$-tagged track-jets form the control region
used to estimate the non-resonant QCD background ($\text{CR}_{\text{QCD}}$)
discussed in chapter \Cref{sec:background:qcd}.  Events with exactly 2 ``tight"
$b$-tagged track-jets form the signal region (SR) where the final fit is
performed.  The 77\% working point used to define the SR was chosen to optimize
signal significance.  For reference, the simulated flavor composition of the SR
is shown in \Cref{fig:selection:flavor_composition}.

(b) The expected shape of the dijet background in the SR and CR normalized to the same event count between $70~\GeV < m_{J} < 230~\GeV$.}

\end{figure}

The QCD estimate is only valid for regions where the SR and
$\text{CR}_{\text{QCD}}$ have a similar dijet mass shape.  This requires in a
lower bound cut on the signal candidate mass of $m_{J} > 70~\GeV$ due to
the higher turn-on curve of the SR shown in \Cref{fig:selection:sr_cr_shape}.
Furthermore, for $m_{J} > 230~\GeV$ the boost from a $\pT$ of $480~\GeV$ is no
longer sufficient to merge two hadrons into a single large-$R$ jet.  Thus the
SR signal candidate masses considered in the analysis range from $70~\GeV$
to $230~\GeV$.

Given the above criteria, the efficiencies and yields in the SR and
$\text{CR}_{\text{QCD}}$ for the resonant backgrounds and the Higgs boson
signal are shown in \Cref{table:efficiencies_and_yields}. The composition of the  vector boson, $t\bar{t}$ and $H
\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ resonant components of the SR and
$\text{CR}_{\text{QCD}}$ are given in \Cref{table:fractional_composition}. For the vector boson background,
the $W+\text{jets}$ contribution dominates in the $\text{CR}_{\text{QCD}}$ due to its
larger cross section.  However, the $Z+\text{jets}$ dominates in the SR as the $Z$
boson can decay to two $b$-quarks.  The $t\bar{t}$
contribution is roughly the same in the SR and $\text{CR}_{\text{QCD}}$ with
$\sim 60\%$ of events decaying entirely to hadrons (all hadronic), $\sim 40\%$
where one top decays leptonically (semi-leptonic), and a small percentage where
both tops decay leptonically (dileptonic). In the SR the dominant $H
\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ production mechanism is ggF, contributing 53\% of the
signal, followed by VBF production with 25\% and Higgstrahlung at 22\%.
