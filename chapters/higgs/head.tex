\chapter{Boosted Higgs at the LHC} \label{chap:higgs}

In \cref{chap:standard_model} I've shown how the higgs mechanism resolves
inconsistencies of the model surrounding the generation of gauge boson and
fermion mass terms while also maintaining gauge invariance.  However to
understand the search for and resulting discovery of this SM Higgs boson
requires the discussion of how one goes about producing and detecting the
physical object itself.  In order to gather sufficient statistics to validate
the theory we require a collider capable of putting enough energy into a
collision to rapidly produce Higgs bosons for study.  To this end the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) discussed in \cref{chap:lhc} was laboriously
designed, funded, and constructed by the largest international collaboration of
scientists on the planet. In this chapter I will discuss the relevant Higgs
boson production mechanisms available at the LHC as well as the various decay
modes of the Higgs that were used for its discovery, and are currently used to
measure its properties.
