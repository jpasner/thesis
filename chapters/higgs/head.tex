\chapter{Boosted Higgs at the LHC} \label{chap:higgs}

The Higgs mechanism, as described in \Cref{sec/theory/gsw} solves the
problem of generating gauge boson and fermion mass terms while also maintaining
gauge invariance.  To understand the search for the SM Higgs boson requires the
discussion of how one goes about producing and detecting it.  In order to
gather sufficient data to validate the theory a collider capable of
putting enough energy into a collision to rapidly produce Higgs bosons for
study is required.  To this end the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) discussed in
\Cref{chap:lhc} was laboriously designed, funded, and constructed by the
largest international collaboration of collider physicists and engineers on the
planet. This chapter will include a discussion of the relevant Higgs boson
production mechanisms available at the LHC and the various decay modes of the
Higgs boson that are used to measure its properties including the final state
that is the focus of this dissertation.
