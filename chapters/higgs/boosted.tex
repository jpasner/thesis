\section{Boosted Higgs} \label{sec:higgs:boosted}

The strong agreement between the theoretical predictions of the SM Higgs boson
and experiment shown in \cref{sec:higgs:higgs_evidence} represents the
fulfillment of a generation of incredible technological and theoretical
achievement.  The next step is to push the search for deviations from the model
that might hint at the physics of mysteries like the matter / anti-matter
asymmetry of the universe, dark matter, the particle nature of gravity and dark
energy.  One such avenue for search comes in the transfer of large ammounts of
momenum in massive particle loops like that of the ggF Higgs production
mechanism.  By more accurately measuring the couplling of the Higgs to the
quarks in these loops, we not only increase our confidence in the SM, we are
also gain access to this possible new physics. To this end, and for the
purposes of suppresing the QCD multijet background, a study of Boosted Higgs
production was undertaken and is discussed further in \cref{part:HbbISR}.
