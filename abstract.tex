A search for high-momentum Higgs bosons, produced with an associated jet and
decaying to bottom quark pairs, is conducted using an integrated luminosity of
$80.5~\ifb$ of proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13~\TeV$ collected
with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider.  The search for $H
\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ is of particular importance, as current measurements of
this decay channel contain large uncertainties and have not yet established
evidence for the gluon-gluon fusion and vector boson fusion Higgs boson
production modes. This is the first time this analysis has been performed with
$\sqrt{s} = 13~\TeV$ at ATLAS and represents an important advancement in the use
of boosted jet techniques including implementation of the Variable Radius jet
algorithm.  Furthermore, a novel $t\bar{t}$ control region strategy is
implemented to correct the mismodeling of its normalization and is shown to
constrain the associated large JES and JMR systematic uncertainties. For the
Standard Model Higgs boson, the observed signal strength is $\mu_{H} = 5.8 \pm
3.1~\mathrm{(stat.)} \pm 1.9~\mathrm{(syst.)} \pm 1.7~\mathrm{(theo.)}$, which
is 1.6 standard deviations higher than the background-only hypothesis, with an
expected sensitivity of $0.28\sigma.$
