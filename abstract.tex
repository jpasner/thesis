A search in the high momentum regime for the decay of Higgs bosons, produced
with an associated jet, to bottom quark pairs is conducted using an integrated
luminosity of $80.5~\ifb$ of proton-proton collisions with $\sqrt{s} = 13~\TeV$
collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider.  The search for
$H \rightarrow b\bar{b}$ is of particular importance as current measurements of
this decay channel contain large uncertainties and have not yet observed the
gluon-gluon fusion and vector boson fusion Higgs boson production modes. This
is the first time this analysis has been performed with $\sqrt{s} = 13~\TeV$ at
ATLAS and thus represents an important advancement in the use of boosted jet
techniques including implementation of the Variable Radius jet algorithm.
Furthermore, my work implementing a novel $t\bar{t}$ control region strategy is
shown to both correct the mismodeling of this important resonant background and
constrain the large JES and JMR systematic uncertainties.  For the Standard
Model Higgs boson, the observed signal strength is $\mu_{H} = 5.8 \pm
3.1~\mathrm{(stat.)} \pm 1.9~\mathrm{(syst.)} \pm 1.7~\mathrm{(theo.)}$, which
is 1.6 standard deviations higher than the background-only hypothesis, with an
expected sensitivity of $0.28\sigma.$
